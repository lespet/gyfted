As to these tasks I hope I undertood the writeup correctly to implement the tasks. 
The recomendations tasks as described to me are rather strange . I worked for recommendation tasks at vtuner.com, a radio and music sreaming company, for over a year. The company exists and it sill works.
The goal of recomendation at vtuner recomendation engine was giving listener a new experience, exploration in music , data came from logs of listening history and goals were measurable, had a purpose learn new music unknown to user . These new sequences were derived from similar users habits or exploration. I loooked at the paper "Playlist Prediction via Metric Embedding" - i think that their approach does not help much their clients, it does not look for satisfaction nor preferences. I do not agree with their model and approach. Vtuner had a big data which included listening habits of all users . Their habits were varied. Based on these data I developed algorithm which using explorate and exploit mixture. Data used were real data and method were based on clustering mostly and also on some random recomendation so clients wer not resticted to the same tracks. I think complexity of that algorithm was to long to cover it in few hours. 
What I developed in tasks 2 and 3 were just random choices. I do not think that a good recomendation approach cannot be implemented based on these data. It requires a dynamic, long time history of user behaviours, and their habits.
