As to these tasks I hope I undertood the writeup correctly to implement the tasks. 
The recomendations tasks are rather strange to me. I worked for recommendation tasks at vtuner.com for over a year. The company exists and it sill works.
The goal of recomendation engine was giving listener a new experience, and goals were measurable. I loooked at the paper "Playlist Prediction via Metric Embedding" - i think that their approach does not help much their clients. Vtuner had a data which included listening habits of all users. Based on these data I developed algorithm which using explorate and exploit mixture. Data used were real data and method were base on clustering mostly and also on some random recomendation so clients wer not resticted to the same tracks. I think complexity of that algorithm was to long to cover it in few hours. 
What I wrote in tasks 2 and 3 were just random choices. I do not think that a good recomendation approach cannot be implemented based on these data. It requires a dynamic, long time history of user behaviours.
