As to these tasks I hope I understood the writeup correctly to implement the tasks. 
The recommendations tasks as described to me are rather strange . I worked for recommendation tasks at vtuner.com, a radio and music streaming company, for over a year. The company exists and it sill works.
The goal of recommendation at vtuner recommendation engine was giving listener a new experience, exploration in music , data came from logs of listening history and goals were measurable, had a purpose learn new music unknown to user . These new sequences were derived from similar users habits or exploration. I looked at the paper "Playlist Prediction via Metric Embedding" - i think that their approach does not help much their clients, it does not look for satisfaction nor preferences. I do not agree with their model and approach. Vtuner had a big data which included listening habits of all users . Their habits were varied. Based on these data I developed algorithm which using explore and exploit mixture. Data used were real data and method were based on clustering mostly and also on some random recommendation so clients were not restricted to the same tracks. I think complexity of that algorithm was too long to cover it in few hours. 
What I developed in tasks 2 and 3 were just random choices. I do not think that a good recommendation approach cannot be implemented based on these data. It requires a dynamic, long time history of user behaviours, and their habits.
